### The provided Python script implements a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. This method is commonly employed for predicting future values based on historical time series data. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key components and steps in the code:

#### Data Loading:

The script begins by loading time series data from an Excel file using the Pandas library.
The 'Time' column is converted to a datetime format to facilitate time-based operations.

#### Rolling Statistics:

Rolling mean and standard deviation are calculated with a window size of 2 to visualize trends in the data.
The rolling statistics plots are commented out but can be uncommented for analysis.

#### Stationarity Test:

The script performs the Dickey-Fuller test to check the stationarity of the time series data.
The test results, including the p-value and critical values, are printed.

#### Log Transformation:

The time series data is transformed using the logarithm to stabilize the variance.

#### Differencing:

First-order differencing is applied to make the time series data stationary.
The differenced data is used for further analysis.

#### ACF and PACF Analysis:

Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are generated to determine the order (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.

#### ARIMA Model:

An ARIMA model is created using the statsmodels library.
The order parameter (p, d, q) is determined based on the ACF and PACF analysis.
The model is fitted to the differenced log-transformed data.

### Model Evaluation:

The fitted ARIMA model is used to predict future values.
The predicted values are inverse-transformed to obtain predictions in the original scale.
The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).

#### Results Visualization:

Various plots are generated to visualize the results, including original vs. predicted values and forecasted values for the next year.
